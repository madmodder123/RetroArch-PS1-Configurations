# RetroArch-PS1-Configurations
A collection of configs for PS1 games that require manually configuration of the multi-tap, correct controller types, and hacks to fix games.

Some games do not support the analog or dualshock controllers and will only function with the standard digital controller first released with the console, some work with the analog and not the dualshock (and vice versa), these configs will set the correct type for each game.
It will also enable the left analog stick to function as the d-pad for games that only support the standard digital controller.

Some games that support the multi-tap will not function correctly when the Retroarch multi-tap settings are set to "Auto", some games want the multitap in the first controller port, others in the second port. This will set the correct values for each game.

Some games also require hacks to function correctly, these have also been included.

Just make sure your ROMs have the same name otherwise the configs won't load!
